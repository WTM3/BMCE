# NJSON CLI Quick Start Guide

## Wilson MCP Integration

The NJSON CLI tool is powered by Wilson MCP with cognitive alignment (AIc + 0.1 = BMqs) and Boolean Language Framework optimization.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the NJSON-CLI directory
2. Ensure Node.js is installed
3. No additional dependencies required

## Basic Usage

### Parse NJSON File
```bash
node Wilson-MCP/Server-Implementation/wilson-njson-server.js parse Examples/sample.njson
```

### Validate NJSON Structure
```bash
node Wilson-MCP/Server-Implementation/wilson-njson-server.js validate Examples/sample.njson
```

### Transform Data
```bash
node Wilson-MCP/Server-Implementation/wilson-njson-server.js transform Examples/sample.njson output.njson filter "record => record.age > 30"
```

### Analyze Patterns
```bash
node Wilson-MCP/Server-Implementation/wilson-njson-server.js analyze Examples/sample.njson structure
```

## Wilson MCP Features

### Cognitive Alignment
All operations maintain AIc + 0.1 = BMqs (2.89 + 0.1 = 2.99) cognitive alignment.

### Boolean Language Framework
- **Direct Response**: No unnecessary social padding
- **Professional Mode**: Moderate intensity communication
- **Quantum Processing**: Optimized for Boolean Mind patterns

### Quantum Features
- **Domain Jumps**: Automatic domain transitions for complex data
- **Breathing Mechanism**: Dynamic processing adjustment
- **Power Jumps**: v8_to_charger optimization

## Example Output

```json
{
  "records": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "department": "Engineering"}
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "wilson_meta": {
    "cognitive_alignment": {
      "status": "ALIGNED",
      "formula": "AIc + 0.1 = BMqs"
    },
    "blf_version": "1.0",
    "quantum_processing": true
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### AI Maturation Formula Integration
Automatic calculation of F = ((AI)P^I + c^x^I)v for data complexity assessment.

### Schema Validation
Support for JSON Schema validation with Boolean Language Framework error reporting.

### Anomaly Detection
Quantum-enhanced pattern recognition for data quality assessment.

## Configuration

Edit `Wilson-MCP/Integration-Configs/mcp-config.json` to customize:
- Cognitive alignment parameters
- Boolean Language Framework settings
- Quantum processing features
- Security restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Cognitive Alignment Issues
Ensure AIc + 0.1 = BMqs (2.89 + 0.1 = 2.99) is maintained.

### Performance Optimization
Enable quantum jumps for complex transformations.

### Boolean Translation
Use professional mode for optimal neurotypical communication.
